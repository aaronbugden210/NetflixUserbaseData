# NetflixUserbaseData
A personal project to get better at creating dashboards in Excel.
I found this data from Kaggle and decided to play around with it a bit.
One thing that was fun was getting the formula for creating the Age Group column.
It seemed like a better way to group certain data so that analysis would be easier, rather can individual ages.
This also gave me a chance to get better at setting up dashboards, whether it was by ensuring that the slicers would adjust themselves with the changing pivot table;
or making sure that the necessary data in the table and chart was protected.
My other goal was to make the color scheme across the dashboard as uniform as possible, opting to keep the scheme in a more monochromatic blue.
